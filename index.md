## JReFrameworker
This project aims to extend previous works by [Erez Metula](https://appsec-labs.com/managed_code_rootkits) by introducing JReFrameworker, a tool to produce MCR capabilities aimed at the Java Runtime Environment in a user-friendly way. 

JReFrameworker is a tool that allows a user to write annotated Java source that is automatically merged or inserted into the runtime.  The framework supports developing and debugging attack modules directly in the Eclipse IDE. Working at the intended abstraction level of source code allows the attacker to "write once, exploit anywhere".

## Getting Started
Ready to get started?

1. First [install](/install) the JReFrameworker plugin.
2. Then check out the provided [tutorials](/tutorials) to get started hacking your first attack module.

## Materials
This tool was presented at [DEFCON 24](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#Holland). Thanks to all those that attended! The JReFrameworker modules developed for the presentation are available in the [github.com/JReFrameworker/modules](https://github.com/JReFrameworker/modules) repository.
