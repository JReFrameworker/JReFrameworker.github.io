This tutorial demonstrates how to modify a victim machine's runtime using a JReFrameworker module.

If you haven't already, you should complete the first two tutorials ([Hello World](./hello-world) and [Hidden File](./hidden-file)) to become familiar with the basics of JReFrameworker.

You will also need to setup a small laboratory test environment that includes the following.

1. A victim machine (the tutorial uses a fresh install of Windows 7 in a virtual machine, but any OS capable of running Java will work).
2. An attacker machine with [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) installed (the tutorial uses a [Kali Linux virtual machine](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)).
3. An installation of JReFrameworker (the tutorial uses the host machine, but any OS that can run [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) with JReFrameworker installed will work).
