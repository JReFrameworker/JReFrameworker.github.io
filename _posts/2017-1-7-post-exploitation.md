This tutorial demonstrates how to modify a victim machine's runtime using a JReFrameworker module.

If you haven't already, you should complete the first two tutorials ([Hello World](./hello-world) and [Hidden File](./hidden-file)) to become familiar with the basics of JReFrameworker.

## Lab Setup

You will also need to setup a small laboratory test environment that includes the following.

1. A victim machine (the tutorial uses a fresh install of Windows 7 in a virtual machine, but any OS capable of running Java will work).
2. An attacker machine with [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) installed (the tutorial uses a [Kali Linux virtual machine](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)).
3. An installation of JReFrameworker (the tutorial uses the host machine, but any OS that can run [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) with JReFrameworker installed will work).

**Note:** For this tutorial we will be using [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com) virtual machines with our victim at `192.168.1.2` and our attacker at `192.168.1.3`. [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) is a good free alternative to VMWare. The next section continues the lab setup to get an active [Metasploit Meterpreter](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/about-meterpreter/) session on the victim machine. If your lab setup is different and you have an exploit, skip to the [Post Exploitation](#PostExploitation) section below.
